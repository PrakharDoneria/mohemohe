<Callout type="warning" txCenter="true" breakBefore="true" id="experiment-1" >**Experiment 1**</Callout>
<Callout type="knowing">**Objective:** Installation and use Java compiler and eclipse platform to write and execute java program. </Callout>

**Theory:**
- Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems *(now owned by Oracle Corporation)*. It was first released in 1995, designed to be platform-independent. *i.e.* Java programs can run on any device or operating system that has a **Java Virtual Machine** (**JVM**) installed.
- Java is widely used for developing a variety of applications, including web applications, mobile apps *(Android applications are widely built using Java)*, enterprise software, and more. Java has a vast ecosystem of libraries, framework, and tools that furture ecnhance its capabilities and productivity for developers.

**Installation of Java Development Kit (JDK):**
- **Java Development Kit** (**JDK**) is essential for Java development as it includes the **Java Runtime Environment** (**JRE**), compiler, debugger and other tools necessary for building Java applications.

- **Visit:** Official Oracle website or OpenJDK website to download the latest version of JDK.
Choose the appropriate JDK version for your operating system *(Windows, macOS, Linux)*.


- Run the downloaded JDK installer executable file. Ensure that the JDK bin directory is added to the system PATH environment variable.

- Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS, Linux). Type `java -version` and press Enter to verify the JDK installation.

```shell title="Terminal"
java -version
openjdk version "11.0.16.1" 2022-08-12 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Microsoft-40648 (build 11.0.16.1+1-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Microsoft-40648 (build 11.0.16.1+1-LTS, mixed mode)
```

**Installation of Eclipse IDE:**
- **Eclipse** is a powerfull IDE widely used by Java developers for coding, debugging, and testing Java applications.

- **Visit:** Eclipse Foundation website and navigate to the downloads section. Run the downloaded Eclipse installer executable file and complete the installation process.

**Installation of Java with Terminal in Linux:**
- For installing **JDK**

```shell title="Terminal"
sudo apt-get install default-jdk
java -version
```

- For installing **Eclipse**
```shell title="Terminal"
sudo snap install eclipse --clasic
```

- Instructions for creating and running it both in **Eclipse** and using the **command line** (**cmd**).

Here's a simple Java program that checks whether a given number is prime or not. 
```java title="Prime.java"
public class Prime {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int num = 29; // Change this number to check prime or not for a different number
		boolean prime = true;
		if (num <= 1) {
			prime = false;
		} else {
			for (int i = 2; i <= num / 2; i++) {
				if (num % i == 0) {
					prime = false;
				}
			}
		}
		if (prime == true) {
			System.out.println(num + " is a prime no.");
		} else {
			System.out.println(num + " is not a prime no.");
		}
	}
}
```


**Running in Eclipse:**
- Open Eclipse and create a new Java project.
- Inside the project, create a new Java class named `Prime`.
- Write the provided Java code into the `Prime.java` file.
- Save the file.
- Right-click on the `Prime.java` file in the Package Explorer.
- Select "**Run As**" -> "**Java Application**".
- Now, the output in the console.

```terminal title="Terminal"
29 is a prime no.
```

Here's a simple Java program that calculates the factorial of a given number. 

```java title="Factorial.java"
public class Factorial {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int number = 5; // Change this number to calculate factorial for a different number
    long factorial = calculateFactorial(number);
    System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " is: " + factorial);
  }

  public static long calculateFactorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
    }
  }
}
```
**Running using CMD:**
- Save the provided Java code into a file named `Factorial.java`.
- Open a command prompt (**CMD**).
- Navigate to the directory where `Factorial.java` is saved using the `cd` command.
- Compile the Java file by typing `javac Factorial.java` and pressing Enter.
- Once compiled successfully, run the program by typing `java Factorial` and pressing Enter.
- You should see the output in the **command prompt**.

```terminal title="Terminal"
Factorial of 5 is: 120
```

<Callout type="warning" txCenter="true" breakBefore="true" id="experiment-2" >**Experiment 2**</Callout>
<Callout type="knowing">**Objective:** Creating simple Calculator java programs using command line arguments. </Callout>

**Theory:**
- **Command-Line Arguments:** Command-line arguments are parameters passed to a program when it is executed. In Java, these arguments are stored in the `args` parameter of the `main` method.
- **Parsing:** Parsing is the process of converting data from one format to another. Here, we parse string arguments into numerical values using methods like `Double.parseDouble()`.
- **Conditional Statements:** The program uses conditional statements (`if` and `switch`) to validate input, handle errors, and perform different operations based on the operator.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Arithmetic operations such as *addition*, *subtraction*, *multiplication*, and *division* are fundamental mathematical concepts. In this program, they are implemented using Java operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- **Error Handling:** Error handling is crucial for robust software. In this program, we handle division by zero by checking for this condition explicitly

```java title="Calculator.java"
public class Calculator {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    if (args.length != 3) {
      System.out.println("Usage: java Calculator num1 operator num2");
      return;
    }

    double num1 = Double.parseDouble(args[0]);
    String operator = args[1];
    double num2 = Double.parseDouble(args[2]);
    double result = 0.0;

    switch (operator) {
      case "+":
        result = num1 + num2;
        break;

      case "-":
        result = num1 - num2;
        break;

      case "*":
        result = num1 * num2;
        break;

      case "/":
        if (num2 != 0) {
          result = num1 / num2;
        } else {
          System.out.println("Error: Division by zero");
          return;
        } break;
      default:
        System.out.println("Error: Invalid operator");
        return;
    }
    System.out.println("Result: " + result);
  }
}
```

To compile this code, open your command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved `Calculator.java`, and run as:

```shell title="Terminal"
javac Calculator.java
```
Once compiled successfully, run the program with command-line arguments as:

```shell title="Terminal"
java Calculator 5 + 3
```

```terminal title="Output"
Result: 8.0
```
Similarly, we can perform other operations like subtraction, multiplication and division:
```shell title="Terminal"
java Calculator 10 - 4
java Calculator 6 * 2
java Calculator 8 / 2
```

<Callout type="knowing">**Objective:** Understand OOP concepts (Abstraction) and basics of Java programming. </Callout>

**Theory:**
- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that type will have.
- Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. Abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction.

```java title="Abstraction.java"
abstract class Car {
  Car() {
    System.out.println("Car is built. ");
  }
  abstract void drive();

  void gearChange() {
    System.out.println("Gearchanged!!");
  }
}

class Tesla extends Car {
  void drive() {
    System.out.println("Drive Safely");
  }
}

class Abstraction {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Car obj = new Tesla();
    obj.drive();
    obj.gearChange();
  }
}
```

```makefile title="Output"
Car is built. 
Drive Safely
Gearchanged!!
```
