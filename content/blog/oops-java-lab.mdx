<Callout type="knowing">**Objective:** Installation and use Java compiler and eclipse platform to write and execute java program. </Callout>

**Theory:**
- Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems *(now owned by Oracle Corporation)*. It was first released in 1995, designed to be platform-independent. *i.e.* Java programs can run on any device or operating system that has a **Java Virtual Machine** (**JVM**) installed.
- Java is widely used for developing a variety of applications, including web applications, mobile apps *(Android applications are widely built using Java)*, enterprise software, and more. Java has a vast ecosystem of libraries, framework, and tools that furture ecnhance its capabilities and productivity for developers.

**Installation of Java Development Kit (JDK):**
- **Java Development Kit** (**JDK**) is essential for Java development as it includes the **Java Runtime Environment** (**JRE**), compiler, debugger and other tools necessary for building Java applications.

- **Visit:** Official Oracle website or OpenJDK website to download the latest version of JDK.
Choose the appropriate JDK version for your operating system *(Windows, macOS, Linux)*.


- Run the downloaded JDK installer executable file. Ensure that the JDK bin directory is added to the system PATH environment variable.

- Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS, Linux). Type `java -version` and press Enter to verify the JDK installation.

```shell title="Terminal"
java -version
openjdk version "11.0.16.1" 2022-08-12 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Microsoft-40648 (build 11.0.16.1+1-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Microsoft-40648 (build 11.0.16.1+1-LTS, mixed mode)
```

**Installation of Eclipse IDE:**
- **Eclipse** is a powerfull IDE widely used by Java developers for coding, debugging, and testing Java applications.

- **Visit:** Eclipse Foundation website and navigate to the downloads section. Run the downloaded Eclipse installer executable file and complete the installation process.

**Installation of Java with Terminal in Linux:**
- For installing **JDK**

```shell title="Terminal"
sudo apt-get install default-jdk
java -version
```

* For installing **Eclipse**
```shell title="Terminal"
sudo snap install eclipse --clasic
```
