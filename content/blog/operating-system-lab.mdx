<Callout type="warning" txCenter="true" >**Experiment 1**</Callout>
<Callout type="knowing">**Objective:** Study of hardware and software requirements of differnet operating systems *(Windows 10, UNIX, Linux, Windows XP, and Windows 7/8)*. </Callout>

**Theory:**
- An **operating syatem** (**OS**) is software that manages and handles the hardware and software resources of a system.It provides intrection between users of computers and computer hardware.
- An operating system is responsible for managing and controlling all the activities and sharing of computer resources.
- An operating system is a low-level software that includes all the basic functions like processor management, memory management, Error detection, etc.

<Callout type="warning" txCenter="true">**Experiment 2** </Callout>
<Callout type="knowing">**Objective:** Execute various system calls. <ul><li>Process Management</li><li>File Management</li><li>Input/Output System Calls</li></ul></Callout>


**Process Management:** Process management uses certain system calls. They are explained below.
- To create a new process - `fork()` is used.
- To run a new program - `exec()` is used.
- To make the process to wait - `wait()` is used.
- To terminate the process - `exit()` is used.
- To find the unique process id - `getpid()` is used.
- To find the parent process id - `getppid()` is used.
- To bias the currently running process property - `nice ()` is used.

*Example program for example of `fork()`*

```c title="fork.c" "fork()" showLineNumbers
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
main()
{
  int pid;
  pid = fork();
  if (pid == 0)
  {
    printf("id of the child process is=%d\n", getpid());
    printf("id of the parent process is=%d\n", getppid());
  }
  else
  {
    printf("id of the parent process is=%d\n", getpid());
    printf("id of the parent of parent process is=%d\n", getppid());
  }
}
```

**OUTPUT** 
``` terminal title="Terminal" showLineNumbers
id of the parent process is=8971
id of the parent of parent process is=8970
id of the child process is=8971
id of the parent process is=8971
```


**File Management:** There are four system calls for file management,
- `open()`:system call is used to know the file descriptor of user-created files. Since read
and write use file descriptor as their 1st parameter so to know the file descriptor `open()`
system call is used.
- `read()`:system call is used to read the content from the file. It can also be used to read
the input from the keyboard by specifying the 0 as file descriptor.
- `write()`: system call is used to write the content to the file.
- `close()`:system call is used to close the opened file, it tells the operating system that you are done with the file and close the file.

*Example program for file management*

```c title="filemgt.c" showLineNumbers
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int n, fd;
  char buff[50];
  printf("Enter text to write in the file:\n");
  n = read(0, buff, 50);
  fd = open("file", O_CREAT | O_RDWR, 0777);
  write(fd, buff, n);
  write(1, buff, n);
  int close(int fd);
  return 0;
}

```

**OUTPUT**

```terminal title="Terminal" showLineNumbers
Enter text to write in the file:
hi how r u?
hi how r u?
```

**Input/Output System Calls:** Basically there are total 5 types of I/O system calls:
- `create()`: Used to Create a new empty file.
- `open()`: Used to Open the file for reading, writing or both.
- `close()`: Tells the operating system you are done with a file descriptor and Close the file
which pointed by fd.
- `read()`: From the file indicated by the file descriptor fd, the `read()` function reads bytes
of input into the memory area indicated by buf. 
- `write()`: Writes bytes from buf to the file or socket associated with fd.

*Example program for Input/output System Calls*

``` c title="input_output.c" showLineNumbers
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main()
{
  char buffer[100];
  int n;

  // Read input from the user
  write(STDOUT_FILENO, "Enter a message: ", 17);
  n = read(STDIN_FILENO, buffer, 100);

  // Write the input back to the user
  write(STDOUT_FILENO, "You entered: ", 13);
  write(STDOUT_FILENO, buffer, n);

  return 0;
}
```
**OUTPUT**
``` terminal title="Terminal" showLineNumbers
Enter a message: helo
You entered: helo
```
