## Operating System OS 

An **operating system** (**OS**) is a program that acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and the computer harware. The purpose of an operating system is to provide an envirnment in which a user can exicute programs in a **convenient** and **effective** manner. 
<br/><t/>An operating system is software that manages a computer harware. It also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer harware. It also called a resource manager because it manages software resources as well as harware in the system. 

<FigureMdx lightUrl="operating-system-diagram" desc="Abstract view of a computer system."/>
A computer system can be devided roughly into four components: the ***hardware,*** the ***operating system,*** the ***aplication programs,*** and the ***users.*** <br/> Because an operating system is large and complex, it must be created piece by piece. Each of these pieces should be a well-defineated portion of the system, with carefully defined inputs, outputs, and functions.

## Function of OS



## Types of Operating System

- **Batch Processing Operating System:**
- **Network Operating System**
- **Distrinuted Operating System**
- **Multiprogramming Operating System**
### Multiprocessing Operating System
An increasingly common way to get major-league computing power is to connect multiple CPUs in a single system. Depending on precisely how they are connected and what is shared, these systems are called parallel computer, multi-computers, or multiprocessing.

### Real-Time Operating System
Another type of operating system is a real time system. These systems are characterized by having time as a key parameter.

- **Clustered Operating System**
- **Multithreaded Operating System**

### Embeded Operating System
Embedded systems run on the computers that control devices that are not generally through of as computers and which do not accept user-installed software.<br/>Typical examples are microwave ovens, TV sets, cars, DVD recorders, traditional phone and MP3 players.

## Dual Mode Operating System

**System Calls**

- **Process control and managment**
- **File managment**
- **Device managment**
- **Memory managment**
- **Inter process communcation**

## Operating-System Structure

- **Simple Structure**
- **Layered Approach**
- **Microkernels**
- **Monolithic**
- **Reentrant**
