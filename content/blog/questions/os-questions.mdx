## (2022-23 KCS 401)

1. **Define two main functions of an operating system.**<br/>
**ANS** wel come to the number world
2. **Explain the principal advantages of multiprogramming.**
3. **Define the term busy waiting.** 
4. **Define semaphore and its types.**<br/>
**ANS** A semaphore is a synchronization mechanism used in Concurrent programming to cintrol access to shared resources by multiple processes or threads. It is essentially a variable or abstract data type is used to solve critical section problems and to achieve process synchronization in multi-processing environments. <br/>

    A semaphore S is an integer variable that, apart from intilization, is accessed only through two standard atomic operations: `wait()` ans `signal()`. The `wait()` operation was originally termed P (from the Dutch ***proberen***, "to test"), `signal()` was originally called V (from ***verhogen***, "to increase"). The defination of `wait()` is as follows:
    ```c 
    wait(S) {
      while (S <= 0)
        ; // busy wait
      S--;
    }
    ```
    The defination of `signal()` is as follows:
    ```c 
    signal(S) {
      S++;
    } 
    ```
