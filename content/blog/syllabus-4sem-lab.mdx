*List of Experiments (Indicative & not limited to)*

**Module 1: Packet Analysis using Wire shark**

1. Basic Packet Inspection: Capture network traffic using Wire shark and analyze basic protocols like 
HTTP, DNS, and SMTP to understand how data is transmitted and received. 
2. Detecting Suspicious Activity: Analyze network traffic to identify suspicious patterns, such as repeated 
connection attempts or unusual communication between hosts. 
3. Malware Traffic Analysis: Analyze captured traffic to identify signs of malware communication, such as 
command-and-control traffic or data infiltration. 
4. Password Sniffing: Simulate a scenario where a password is transmitted in plaintext. Use Wireshark to 
capture and analyze the packets to demonstrate the vulnerability and the importance of encryption. 
5. ARP Poisoning Attack: Set up an ARP poisoning attack using tools like Ettercap. Analyze the captured 
packets to understand how the attack can lead to a Man-in-the-Middle scenario.

**Module 2: Web Application Security using DVWA**

1. SQL Injection: Use DVWA to practice SQL injection attacks. Demonstrate how an attacker can 
manipulate input fields to extract, modify, or delete database information. 
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Exploit XSS vulnerabilities in DVWA to inject malicious scripts into web pages. 
Show the potential impact of XSS attacks, such as stealing cookies or defacing websites. 
3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Set up a CSRF attack in DVWA to demonstrate how attackers can 
manipulate authenticated users into performing unintended actions. 
4. File Inclusion Vulnerabilities: Explore remote and local file inclusion vulnerabilities in DVWA. Show how 
attackers can include malicious files on a server and execute arbitrary code. 
5. Brute-Force and Dictionary Attacks: Use DVWA to simulate login pages and demonstrate brute-force 
and dictionary attacks against weak passwords. Emphasize the importance of strong password policies.
