**The Theory of Automata** 
<Callout type="knowing">In this chapter we begin with the study of automaton. We deal with transition systems which are more general than finite automata. </Callout>

An **automaton** is defined as a system where energy, materials and information are transformed, transmitted and used for performing some functions without direct participation of man.<br/>Examples are automatic machine tools, automatic packing machines and automatic photo painting machine.
