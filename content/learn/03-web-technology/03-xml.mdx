## eXtensible Markup Language XML
- XML stands for extensible markup language.
- it is like HTML and was designed to describe data.
- ```<xml>``` tags are not predefined you must define your own page.
- XML use a document type definition (DTD) or an XML schema to describe the data.
- XML with a DTD or XML schema is desigred to be safe descriptive.
- XML is a cross platform software and hardware independent tool for transmitting information.

## XML uses
- XML can work behind the schema to simplify the creation of html document for large website.
- XML can be used to exchange the information between organisation and system.
- XML can be used for uploading and reloading of database.
- It can be used to store and arrange the data which customiges your data handling needs.
- XML can easily be merged with stylesheets to create almost any desired output.

### Difference between HTML and XML.
| HTML  | XML   |
| ----- | ----- |
| This is a markup language. | This is standard markup language that defines other markup language. |
| It is not case sensitive. | It is case sensitive. |

| Some of the tools are used for the HTML are Visual Studio (VS) code, Atom, Notepad++ and many more. | Some of the tools are used for xml or Oxygen XML, XML notepad and many more. |

### XML is self destructive because &mdash;
- It contains send information.
- It contain receiver information.
- It contains body information.
- It content massage information.

## Document Type Defination (DTD)
- A DTD defines the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an xml document.
- It validate the xml document.
- Correct syntax is called *Well formed*. But validate against DTD is both *well formed* and *valid*.

### Valid XML Document
- A valid XML document is well formed as well as it conformed the rule of DTD.
- The purpose of DTD is to define the structure and legal element attribute of an XML Document.
- ```.dtd``` is used to save files.
