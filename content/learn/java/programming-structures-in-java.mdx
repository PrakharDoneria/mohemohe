## Classes in Java
Classes is fundamental to object-oriented programming. Here's a basic example of how to define a class in Java
- We've defined a class named `MyClass`.
- It has two fields. `myField` of `int`, and `anotherField` of type `String`.
- It has a Constructor `MyClass(int myField, String anotherField)` that initializes these fields.
- It has getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying these fields.

```java title="MyClass.java"
public class MyClass {
  // Fields (attributes)
  private int myField;
  private String anotherField;

  // Constructor
  public MyClass(int myField, String anotherField) {
    this.myField = myField;
    this.anotherField = anotherField;
  }

  // Methods
  public int getMyField() {
    return myField;
  }

  public void setMyField(int myField) {
    this.myField = myField;
  }

  public String getAnotherField() {
    return anotherField;
  }

  public void setAnotherField(String anotherField) {
    this.anotherField = anotherField;
  }
} 
```
- Create an intance of this class and manipulate its fields.

```java title="Main.java"
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    MyClass obj = new MyClass(10, "Hello");
    System.out.println(obj.getMyField());
    System.out.println(obj.getAnotherField());

    obj.setMyField(20);
    obj.setAnotherField("World");

    System.out.println(obj.getMyField());
    System.out.println(obj.getAnotherField());
  }
}
```

```makefile title="Output"
10
Hello
20
World
```

Given examples are just a basic. Classes can have more complex structure, including inheritance, interfaces, and other features of object-oriented programming.

## Modifiers in Java
Modifier is conceivable to alter classes and systems by utilizing modifiers. There are two classifications of modifiers &mdash;
- **Access Modifiers:** public, default, protected and private
- **Non-access Modifiers:** static, final and abstract.

### Access Modifiers
Java gives various access modifiers to set access levels for classes, fields, variables, routines and constructors. It is also known as **Access Specifiers**. The four right to gain access are &mdash;
- **Private:** visible to the class.
- **Default:** visible to the bundle. No modifiers are required
- **Protected:** visible to all subclasses and package.
- **Public:** visible to the world.

|   | Private | No Modifier | Protected | Public |
| :------- |------|------ | ------- | -------- |
| Same class | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Same package subclass | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Same package non-subclass | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Different package subclass | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Different package non-subclass | No | No | No | Yes |

Here's the example of access modifier.
```java title="MyClass.java"
package mypackage;

public class MyClass {
  public int publicField;
  protected int protectedField;
  int defaultField;    // package-private
  private int privateField;

  public MyClass() {
    // Constructor
  }

  public void publicMethod() {
    // Method with public access
  }

  protected void protectedMethod() {
    // Method with package-private access
  }

  private void privateMethod() {
    // Method with private access
  }
}
```
- `publicField` is accessible from any class.
- `protectedField` is accessible within its package and by subclasses.
- `defaultField` is accessible within its package.
- `privateField` is accessible only within its own class.
- `publicMethod()`, `protectedField()`, and `defaultField()` have similar access levels as thir corresponding fields.
- `privateMethod()` is accessible only within its own class.


### Non Access Modifiers
Java gives various non-access modifiers to attain numerous other usefulness.
- **Static:** The static modifier for making class variables and methods.
- **Final:** The final modifier for concluding the executions of classes, variables and methods.
- **Abstract:** This modifier is used for creating abstract methods and classes.
- **Volatile and Synchronized:** These modifiers and typically used for threads.

## Static Members 
The class level members which have static keyword in their definition are called static members.Static members are those that belong to the class itself, rather than being associated with an instance of the class. Let's explore the different types of static members &mdash;

- **Static Methods:** These are the methods declared with the `static` keyword. Like static variables, static methods belong to the class rather than to instances of the class. They can be called direcly using the class name without creating an object of the class.

```java 
public class MyClass {
  static void myStaticMethod() {  // static method
    System.out.println("This is a static method.");
  }
}
```

- **Static Variables (Class Variables):** These are variables declared with the `static` keyword. They are shared among all instances of the class. Static variables are initialized only once, at the start of the execution, and retain their values throughout the program's lifetime.

```java
public class MyClass {
  static int count = 0;
}
```

- **Static Blocks:** These are blocks of code enclosed in curly braces `{}` and preceded by the `static` keyword. They are executed only once when the class is loaded into memory. Static blocks are typically used to initialize static variables.

```java
public class MyClass {
  static {
    System.out.println("Static blocks is executed.");
  }
}
```
- **Static Nested Classes:** These are nested classes thet are declared as static. They can access only static members of the outer class.

```java
public class OuterClass {
  static class StaticNestedClass {
    void display() {
      System.out.println("Static nested class");
    }
  }
}
```

## Final Members
The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable *i.e.* impossible to inherit or override. Final keyword is the part of modifier which are already studed. The final keyword can be applied to variables, methods, and classes, each with its own significance.

- **Final Variables** (**Constants**)**:** When applied to a variable, the `final` keyword indicates that the variable's value cannot be changed after it has been initialized. Final variables are essentially constants and must be initialized exactly once, either at the time of declaration or within a constructor. Once initialized, their values cannot be modified.

```java
public class MyClass {
  final int MY_CONSTANT = 10;   // final variable
}
```

- **Final Methods:** When applied to a method, the `final` keyword indicates that the method cannot be overridden by subclasses. This means that subclasses cannot provide a different implementation of the final method. Final methods are typically used to enforce certain behaviors in a class hierarchy.

```java
public class ParentClass {
  public final void finalMethod() { // final method
    // method implemntation
  }
}

public class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
  /* this will result in a compilation error because 
  finalMethod() cannot be overridden. */
}
```

- **Final Classes:** When applied to a class, the `final` keyword indicates that th class cannot be subclassed. This means that no other class can inherit from a final class. Final classes are often used when a class is desiged to be immutable or when its behavior should not be altered or extended.

```java
final public class FinalClass { // final class
  // class members and methods
}
```

## Comments in Java
Just an in the case of C++ and C, Java supports two types of comments namely, single line comments and multi-line comments. The syntax for these types of comments are as follows &mdash;

- Single line comment
```java
//<comment>
```
- Multiple line comment
```java
/*<commnet 
line 2
.
.
line n>*/
```
All characters that exist in the comments region are simply ignored by the Java compiler.

Any line that is only composed of whitespace characters or comments is considered a blank line. These lines are just ignored by the compiler and are not included in the executable.


## Data Types
Data types specify the type of data that can be stored in a variable. Java supports several built-in data types, which can be categorised into two main categories &mdash;
- Primitive data types and
- Referance data types

**Primitive data types:** These are basic data types provided by Java.
- Numeric types: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `float`, `double`
- Text types: `char`
- Logical type: `boolean`

```java title="Example.java"
int myNum = 7;                // Integer
float myFloatNum = 8.74f;     // Floating Point Number
char myChar = 'P';            // Character
boolean myBool = true;        // Boolean
String myText = "Hello";      // String
```
There are mainly eight types of primitive data types in Java programming &mdash;
| Data Type | Characteristics | Range |
|:---------:|:--------------- |:-----|
| `byte` | **8 bit** signed integer | **-128** to **127** |
| `short` | **16 bit** signed integer | **-32768** to **32767** |
| `int` | **32 bit** signed integer | **2E-31** to **2E+30** |
| `long` | **64 bit** signed integer | **2E-63** to **2E+62** |
| `float` | **32 bit** floating point number | **&pm; 1.4E-45** to **&pm; 3.4028235E+38** |
| `double` | **64 bit** floating point number | **&pm; 4.9E-324** to **&pm; 1.7976931348623157E+308** |
| `boolean` | **1 bit** `true` or `false` | **NA** |
| `char` | **16 bit**, Unicode | **Unicode character**, `\u0000` to `\uFFFF` can mix with hexadecimal number. |

**Referance data types:** These are non-primitive data types that include objects, arrays, and user-defined types.

## Variables in Java
Manipulation of data is performed with the help of variables. Data is stored in the memory and a named referance to this memory location is called a variable. Any identifier is declared as a variable by preceding it with a keyword `var`. Sample declaration of a variable is.

```java 
var result;
var result1 = 0;
var result2 = 23 * 4 + 6;
```
Certain rules have to be followed while naming variables. These are the following rules &mdash;
- A variable name can be a combination of numbers and characters.
- A variable name cannot start with a number.
- The only special characters allowed in variable names is underscore `_` and dollar sign `$`.
- There should not be any whitespace in the variable name. e.g. `result value` is not allowed.
- JavaScript keywords are reserved and cannot be used.

Another convention used in JavaScript is to name variables such that th e first letter of the variable name is lowercase.
