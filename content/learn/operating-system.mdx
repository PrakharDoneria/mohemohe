# Operating System OS 

An **operating system** (**OS**) is a program that acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and the computer harware. The purpose of an operating system is to provide an envirnment in which a user can exicute programs in a **convenient** and **effective** manner. 
<br/><t/>An operating system is software that manages a computer harware. It also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer harware. It also called a resource manager because it manages software resources as well as harware in the system.

A computer system can be devided roughly into four components: the ***hardware,*** the ***operating syatem,*** the ***aplication programs,*** and the ***users.*** <br/> Because an operating system is large and complex, it must be created piece by piece. Each of these pieces should be a well-defineated portion of the system, with carefully defined inputs, outputs, and functions.
