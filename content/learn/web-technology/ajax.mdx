## AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript & XML)
 AJAX is a technique for creating asynchronous with application.
 It allows web pages to communicate with server in the background with requiring full page reloads.
 This enhances the user experience by making web pages feel, move, responsive and interactive.

### Working of AJAX
- **Event trigger:** A user interaction on a web page on AJAX Request.
- **`XMLHttpRequest` objects:** It is created by JavaScript which act as a messenger between the web page and server.
- **Request configuration:** configure several parameters to define how the request interacts with the server.
- **Parameters:** Choosing appropriate HTTP method based on required action like as `submit`, `update`, `retrieve`, `delete`, etc. Specifing correct URL for server side script including necessary data in request.
- **Asynchronous communication:** The `XMLHttpRequest` object send the request to the server asynchronously. *i.e.* The browser doesn't freeze while getting towards server responses and user can continue interaction with the page.
- **Server-Side Processing:** The server receive the request process it and generate response.
- **Request handling:** The `XMLHttpRequest` object receive the response from the server. JavaScript can then use the response data to update a specific part of the web page without reloading the entire page.

## Advantage of AJAX
- **Improve overall user experience:** AJAX allows web applcation to update the specific part of page without reloading the entire page. That makes smoother and more responsive interactions.
- **Reduce the server load:** AJAX reduces the amount of data exchange between client and server, leading to lower server load and bandwidth usage.
- **Dynamic and faster update:** AJAX enables faster data retrival and rendring, that makes dynamic and quicker response to user actions.
- **Enhanced user interaction:** User can interact with web application at the real-time and similar to the Desktop Applications, that makes users to more interactive and engaging.
- **Flexible for Server-Side communication:** Enabling the retrival and submission of data asynchronously, without interrupting the user's interaction with the page.

### Application of AJAX
- **Live chat application:** Enable real-time messaging without reloading the whole page.
- **Social media fields:** Using AJAX, to update feeds, posts, comments, and notification at real-time dynamically.
- **Real-time data application:** Display live updates like stock prices, score board and weather.
- **Form validation:** It can provide immediate feedback if errors or incomplete fields are there.
- **Page scrolling:** Infinite page scroll happen when additional content are loaded. This is commonly used in social media feeds, reels, and e-commerce sites.
