## Client Server Computing
It is a fundamental architecture for distributing task and resource across a network.
It relies on two key players client and servers &mdash;

### Client:
- These are the software programs or device that initiate request for a resorts or services.
- They have a user interface that interact with the server. *e.g.* Mobile Apps, E-mail, etc.

### Server:
- These are powerful computers or programs that fullfil client request.
- They store data, perform calculation and manage network resources.
- They are capable of handling multiple client simultaneously.


## Working of Client Server Computing
### Request:
- Client request to the server.
- Request specifies resource or service such as web page a file download or a database query.

### Processing:
- Server receive the request, process it and perform the requested operation.

### Response:
- Server sends response back to the client.
- Response may be a confirmation message or an error message.

## Advantage of client-server computing
- Easy backup and updates.
- Additional servers can be added to ease the workload.
- Easy to share resources.
- Centralised storage is allows more secure access to data and application.

## Disadvantage of client-server computing
- If server fails, all connected clients are affected and loss access to resource.
- Initial access a lot to setup a client server computing resources.
- Server can go down in case of number of request of clients exceeded the servers processing capacity.
- Slow or unstable network can affect the overall performance.
