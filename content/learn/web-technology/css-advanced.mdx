## Grouping
- Grouping in CSS is a technique used to reduce code redundancy and write clean, concise, easy to follow code.
- These are many instance in which multiple css selector will have same declaration.
- In this cases, we can group all the selectors together and write their declaration only one time. *e.g.*
```css title="normal"
h1 {
    font-size: 10px;
    color: green;
}
h2 {
    font-size: 10px;
    color: green;
}
```
```css title="grouping"
h1 h2 {
    font-size: 10px;
    color: green;
}
```

## Dimention
It is defined as the border that surrounds every box *i.e.* element padding that can appear inside each box and the margin that can go around them.

Along properties allows us to control the dimensions of a box &mdash;
- **The height and width properties**: It allows us to set the height and width for boxes, they can take value of length, a percent or the keyword.
- **The line height property**: It allows us to increase the space between lines of the text. The value of line height property can be a number, a length, a percentage.
- **The maximum height property**: It allows us to specify maximum height of a box. The value of maximum height property can be a number, a length or a percentage.
- **The minimum height property**: It allows us to specify minimum height of a box. The value of minimum height property can be a number, a length or a percentage.
- **The maximum width property**: It allows us to specify maximum width of a box. The value of maximum width property can be a number length or a percentage.
- **The minimum width property**: It allows us to specify minimum width of a box. The value of minimum width property can be a number length or a percentage.

## Display 
### Controlling the display of an element using CSS
- It allows us to control the display of HTML element by using the display visibility property. The display property specifies how to display an element while the visibility property specify whether should be ```hidden``` or ```visible```.
- The display property is used to display element specify in manner. It generates the particular type of box of an element. This property take different value in which ```inline```, ```block``` and ```none``` are most common.
- The feasibility property is specifies whether an element is visible or a web based or node it takes four value ```visible```, ```hidden```, ```collapse``` and ```inherit```.

## Position property
This property is specified how an element is partitioned in a document. The top, right, bottom and left property define the location of positioned element.

There are five different position value &mdash;
- **```position: static;```**: By default HTML element are positioned static. they are not affected by top, bottom, left and right property. The static is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.
- **```position: relative;```**: The box position is calculated according to the normal flow by applying the properties top, right, bottom and left. The relatively positioned element will cause it to be adjust away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
- **```position: absolute;```**: The box is taken out of the normal flow. The box position is specified with the top, right, bottom and left.

### Floating  property
Css allows us to implement the text feature into web page by using the float property. This property means an HTML element has a floated element defines the side where other element are display.
```css title="Syntax"
float: [value];
```
The float property supports the following value &mdash;
- **```left```**: Float an elements to the left to respect to the content.
- **```right```**: Float an element to the right to respect to the content.
- **```none```**: Doesn't flow an element.

## Pseudo Class
- Pseudo classes are predefined class that enable to able apply certain styling, rule or a specific state of an element.
- These classes allow to style, visit or unvisited links, or to specify how to link or redirected in response to user actions.
- Pseudo element referred to subpart of the element such as the first letter of paragraph.
- Pseudo classes and pseudo elements allow us to style the first line of the paragraph and first letter of a word.
- Pseudo classes are used to at special effect to the selectors such as changing the colour of the visited links.
- The selectors are the name, given to different style. A pseudo class always start with **colon** ```:```.

## CSS Navigation Bar
- In CSS, a navigation bar is also known as **nav bar**. which is used in an interface to provide navigation link or menus to the various selectors or page users in website design.
- User can easily navigate a website content using it as a visual guide with the help of a navigation bar. We can improve the presentation and styling of the Web page and it also include ```design```,```color```, ```fonts``` and ```spacing``` descrived using CSS.

## Image Sprites
- It is a collection of images put into a single image.
- A web page with many images can take a long time to load and generates multiple server request.
- Using image strips will reduce the number of server requests and save bandwidth.

## CSS Color Property 
The color property specify the color of text. It accept value like named colors: **RGB**, **RGBA**, **HSL** and **HSLA**. This property plays a crucial role in defining *text appearance*, *ensuring readability* and *enhancing* the overall design of web content.
- **```color```**: It will set the colour to the text which the programmer specifies in the css file. The color can be set to the text in the foreground.
- **```color:[name]```**: By directly specifing the name of the colour like **<span style={{color: "blue"}}>blue</span>**, **<span style={{color: "green"}}>green</span>**, **<span style={{color: "pink"}}>pink</span>**, **<span style={{color: "tomato"}}>tomato</span>**, etc.


They are the following property value &mdash;
- **RGB value**: Here **R** stand for RED, **G** stand for Green and **B** stand for Blue. The colour will be assigned to the text by using the range of these values. The values in this form **(0 - 255)**.
    ```css title="Syntax"
    RGB(255, 0, 0)  /*RED*/
    RGB(0, 255, 0)  /*GREEN*/
    RGB(0, 0, 255)  /*BLUE*/
    ```
- **Hexadecimal value**: It represents the value of the colour in hexadecimal format. It should start with the prefix ```#```. These values ranges from ```#000000``` to ```#ffffff```.
