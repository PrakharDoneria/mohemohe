# Scripting
Scripting means writing scripts, which are smaller programs designed to automate tasks, managing system processes, or perform specific functions in larger applications. 
- Those programming language which uses interpreter to execute the source code directly, without any compilation. 
- There are many scripting languages&mdash; Python, [JavaScript](/learn/web-technology/js#javascript), Bash, Perl, Ruby, PHP, etc.


## JavaScript
 JavaScript is a high level versatile and interpreted programming language used to create dynamic content on web.
 It was developed by [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) for *Netscape* and it was initially known as **LiveScript** but later renamed to **JavaScript**.
- Used as Client Side Scripting Language executing code on users browser.
- Used for multiple development fields defining its versality.
- It borrows much of syntax from C, includeing curly braces and control structures as `if`, `for`, `while`, etc.
- **JavaScript is used for &mdash;** Web development, Server side development, Game development, Mobile app devlopment, etc. 

<Callout>**Need to know:**<br/> JavaScript has no direct relationship with [Java](/learn/java). It was named to Capitalise on Java's popularity at that time. </Callout>


### JavaScript is Good for Frontend Language
JavaScript is plays a crucial role in developing dynamic and interactive web pages. Here is the breakdown of the main functions &mdash;
- **Client signed interactivity:** JavaScript runs on the client browser, enabling interactivity without loading to communicate with the server.
- **DOM Manipulation:** The Document Object Model represent the structure of HTML document as a tree structure.
- **Event handling:** JavaScript enables developers to define actions that occurs in response to user interaction.
- **Framework and libraries:** JavaScript has a rich ecosystem of framework and libraries such as React, Angular, Vue.js, jQuery, Moment.js, etc.

### Advantage of JavaScript
- **Easy to learn and implement:** JavaScript's syntax is beginner friendly. 
- **Popularity:** It is one of the most widely-used programming language and supported by all mazor web browser.
- **Interpretability:** JavaScript code is interpreted directly by the web browser.
- **Server load deduction:** JavaScript runs on the client side reducing the load on the serer and improving overall application perfromance.

### Disadvantages of JavaScript
- **Client side security:** It can be exploited for malicious purposes until not properly secured.
- **Browser support:** It may have inconsistencies across different browsers.

## Java vs JavaScript

|         Java                    |           JavaScript              |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Java is Object Oriented Programming language.(**OOPs**) | JavaScript is Scripting language.|
| Compiled to byte code.          | Interpreted at runtime.           |
| Uses [`jvm`](/learn/java/why-java#jvm-java-virtual-machine) for execution. | Executed at client server.        |
| It is multithreaded.            | It is event based.                |
| Faster due to pre compilation.  | Slower due to interpretation.     |
| Supports large standard libraries. | Relies on framework.           |
| It is denoted by `.java` extension. | It is denoted by `.js` extension. |
| Checks extension for compile time error. | Relies on runtime error. |
| Method are defined within classes. | Functions can be declared anywhere. |
| Used for app development.       | Mostly used for web development.  |
| Large scale system.             | Fronted interactivity.            |

### Documents
The Document Object Model (DOM), is the fundamental API for repersenting and manipulating the content of HTML and XML documents.
- **Accessing DOM Elements:** JavaScript have several methods to manipulate HTML elements.

|     Method        |         Description       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| `document.getElementById("myId");` | Access through element `id`. |
| `document.getElementByClassName("myClass");`| Access through element `class`. |
| `document.getElementByTagName("div");` | Access through element `tag`. |
| `document.querySelector(".myClass");` | Access single element with any. |
| `document.querySelectorAll(".myClass");` | Access all element with any. |
- **Manipulating DOM Elements:** It can modify the content, attributes, and style of HTML elements.

|         Property/Method            |         Description             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `element.innerHTML = "New Content";` | Modify the inner HTML of an element. |
| `element.style.color = "blue";`    | Modify the style/color value to an HTML element. |
| `element.setAttribute("src", "img.jpg");` | Modify the attribute value of an HTML element. |

### Forms
The `document.forms` property in JavaScript provides a collection of all `<form>` elements. This makes easy access and manipulate the forms and their elements.
<Callout>**Need to know:**<br/> Similarly, all the `form`'s componentes are access using the `HTMLFormElement.elements` property. </Callout>



## Statements
JavaScript statements are instructions that a browser excutes to perform a specific action. Its statement are terminated with semicolon. JavaScript statements are composed by the following statements&mdash; Variables, Operation, Expressions, Keywords and Comments. 
- **Variable Decleration:** It is used to create variables to store the data values. *keywords are* [`var`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var), [`let`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let), and [`const`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const).
- **Conditional Statement:** It execute or skip other statements depending on the value of a specified expression. These statement are dessision based, common Conditional statements are `if`, [`if...else`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else), [`switch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch).
- **Loop Statement:** It repeat a block of code until specified condition is true. Loop statements are [`for`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while), [`while`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while), and [`do...while`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while).
- **Try-Catch Statement:** It handles exceptions that occur in the try block, allowing the program to continue running. [`try...catch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch), and `finally`.

```js title="SwitchFunc.js" showLineNumbers
function convert(x) {
  switch (typeof x) {
    case 'number':        // Convert number to hexadecimal integer
      return x.toString(16);
    case 'string':        // Return the sttring encosed in quotes
      return '"' + x + '"';
    default:              // Convert any othr type in the usual way
      return String(x);
  } 
}
```


## Functions
A JavaScript function is a block of code that is defined once but may be executed, invoked, any number of times.
A function defination may includes a list of identifiers, known as *parameters* that works as local variable for the body of the function.
- Functions are defined with the `function` keyword with a name.
- Functions often use their argument values to compute a `return value`.

```js title="FactorialFunc.js" showLineNumbers
function factorial(x) {
  if (x <= 1) return 1;
  return x * factorial(x-1);
}
```

## Objects
An object is an unordered collection of properties, each has a name and a value. we are already familier with the fundamental data structure which are named as **hash**, **hashtable**, **dictionary**, or **associative array**.

```js title="ObjectSyntax.js" showLineNumbers
let student = {
  firstName: "Prince",
  lastName: "Kunal",
  age: 23,
  greet: function() {
    return "नमस्ते, " + this.firstName;
  }
}
```
**Accessing Object Properties:** There are two method to access the object properties&mdash;
```js title="AccesProperties.js" showLineNumbers
// Dot Notations
console.log(student.firstName);     // Prince  

// Bracket Notations 
console.log(student["firstName"]);  // Prince
```
