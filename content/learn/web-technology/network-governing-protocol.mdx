## Directly Governing the Web
- **Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP):** It defines how the browsers and server communicate and how a browser request a web page from a server.

- **Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS):** It encrypts the common between the logging credentials and information, etc.

## Indirectly Governing the Web 
- **Transmission Control Protocol/ Internal Protocol (TCP/IP):** TCP is responsibile for transmission of data into packets and ensure reliable delivery. 

    IP assigns unique address to devices for network routing.
- **Domain Name System (DNS):** It translate human readable domain names into machine readable IP address that computer used to locate web server. 
    
    Some additional protocols that don't involved in web browsing but are crucial for maintaining overall ecosystem.
- **File Transfer Protocol (FTP):** It is used for transferring files between computers.
- **E-mail:** Users subtrate protocols for sending (SMTP) to require (POP3/ IMAP).

- **Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3):** It is an internet standard protocol on the application layer that the local email client used for retrieving emails from any remote server over the TCP/IP connection.
- **Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP):** It is a protocol that allow distant users to access their emails directly from the server and read them on any devices at any location feasible for them.
- **Telnet:** An older protocol for remote access. It allowed you to login into another system and brows files and dictionaries on that remote system.
- **User Datagram Protocol (UDP):** It is a connection less protocol for data transfer. It is faster but less reliable.
- **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP):** It doesn't directly involved in data transmission but carries informational message between network devices like error message indicating unsuccessful packet delivery.
