## XML Schema

- The XML object model is a collection of objects that you use to assess and manipulate the data stored in an xml document.
- The xml document is moduled after a tree in which each element in the tree is a node.
- Objects with various properties and method represent the tree and its nodes.
- Each node contains actual data in the document.

    - Object based: DOM 
    - Event based: Push parser/ Pull parser.
